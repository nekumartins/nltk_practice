25/05/2023, 16:55 - Neku: ive fixed it now
25/05/2023, 16:55 - Neku: i decided to wipe my hard drive
25/05/2023, 16:57 - Neku: basically yeah, my roomate and i arent really on speaking terms,(youre gonna see him tofay if we do meet)
25/05/2023, 16:59 - Neku: so he collected some videos on my hard drive, theyre kinda hard to find on the net so yeah, he collects them without asking me(deleted some of them when he wasnt around tho(yeah, im petty like that) because why would you not be talking to me and .. yk
25/05/2023, 17:00 - Neku: i decided to encrypt my drive then
25/05/2023, 17:00 - Neku: but i wanteed to format is as well
25/05/2023, 17:01 - Neku: idk why i decided to use linux for a drive thats mostly used for devices running windopws
25/05/2023, 17:02 - Neku: but when i encrypted it, it made the file system exfat
25/05/2023, 17:04 - Neku: so like after transferring my files to a computer in the library, i formatted the drive, transferring all the files took a truckload of time so i was already tired
25/05/2023, 17:05 - Neku: when i then plugged the hard drive back into the pc at the library it didnt even show up,found out it needed to be ntfs for it to work so i had to rewrite it
25/05/2023, 17:06 - Neku: which took another truck load of time on linux cos it had to initialise all the bits to zero or some shit
25/05/2023, 17:07 - Neku: decided to use my disk manager instead and it showed it was alriight but i was still now seeing the drive when i plugged it into the system
25/05/2023, 17:08 - Neku: i just had to go to the hall with my stuff still on the librarys pc because it was already time for church when i was leaving therre
25/05/2023, 17:10 - Neku: i just signed in for church and went back to my hall to try and fix the drive, decided to use windows instead this time tho
25/05/2023, 17:10 - Neku: still couldnt see the drive but it was playing a sound
25/05/2023, 17:11 - Neku: when i went to hard drives management thats when i saw it, just they with unallocated space, i named the volume but didnt give it a path still{like those letters C, D and that
25/05/2023, 17:12 - Neku: just there*
25/05/2023, 17:13 - Neku: thats when i realised i need to specify a path for windows to see it
25/05/2023, 17:13 - Neku: i did that and i saw it, also found out that using bitlocker was way much easier than the way i had previously done to lock the drive
25/05/2023, 17:14 - Neku: so i basically went through all that stress out of pettyness
25/05/2023, 17:14 - Neku: still locked the drive tho
25/05/2023, 17:15 - Neku: library was locked last night when i came back so i had to spend the night worried if imma find my data when i get back cos it was 218gb, id have just fallen sick if anything had happened to it
25/05/2023, 17:17 - Neku: luckily it was there when i got here this afternoon, been here since 3:30 and its now 76% done so yeah, thats it

26/05/2023, 15:45 - Favour: Also can you help me ask Pelumi for the slides?🥺
26/05/2023, 18:21 - Neku: It's not weird at all I completely understand, almost everyone at some point has thought like that
26/05/2023, 19:18 - Neku: It's totally fine to not really have a direction at this point in your life, you're just starting so you actually have time to test all the waters, do the ones you get the most joy from or the one you think you really want to learn be it challenging or not, It'd have been nice to have this conversation in person sha, but yeah once you get the thrill from completing a task it kinda gives you motivation
26/05/2023, 19:23 - Neku: Because in this tech stuff motivation is kinda the only thing that's important, the what motivates doesn't even matter as far as it's there
26/05/2023, 19:24 - Neku: You can even get tired at some point and decide to do something different for a change and find out you wanna do this instead
26/05/2023, 19:24 - Favour: Yeah
I'd really prefer this conversation in person🫠
26/05/2023, 19:25 - Neku: I'm free whenever

27/05/2023, 17:29 - Neku: They should have just let me use nano
27/05/2023, 17:29 - Neku: Tbf tho they kinda work similarly
27/05/2023, 17:30 - Neku: I wanted to install nano on my sandbox but idk if that's possible
27/05/2023, 17:31 - Neku: So i just use touch to create the files and emacs to edit it
27/05/2023, 17:32 - Favour: 😂😂
27/05/2023, 17:34 - Favour: <Media omitted>
27/05/2023, 17:38 - Neku: I was thinking of just using my system for projects cos the webterm is laggy asf, that's the sandbox yeah, they did say you could restart it if you run into problems according to them it would fix most of the problems
27/05/2023, 17:39 - Neku: Nano is a text editor
27/05/2023, 17:40 - Neku: Kinda like vi but less complicated
27/05/2023, 17:41 - Neku: Start up times for all them terminal text editors is like insanely fast compared to ides, that's why people would use em
27/05/2023, 17:42 - Neku: Also in the sandbox description it says emacs and vi already installed i think
27/05/2023, 17:43 - Neku: Suprising that nano wasn't installed since it's ubuntu
27/05/2023, 17:52 - Neku: <Media omitted>

Yh you can
27/05/2023, 21:10 - Neku: Nano isn't the main one for ubuntu per say it just comes installed with it, along with vi
27/05/2023, 21:11 - Neku: But nano is easier than vi as well, i used to be scared of nano too during my chatgpt endeavours
27/05/2023, 21:11 - Neku: It'd tell me to open nano and I'm like wtf is this
27/05/2023, 21:16 - Neku: Yeah

25/07/2023, 13:51 - Neku: You could try and imitate a stack like that, iterate over the characters and check for your cases then concatenate accordingly

25/07/2023, 13:53 - Favour: Do I even know how to work with stacks?🥲

25/07/2023, 13:58 - Neku: Pop returns what the last thing we appended
25/07/2023, 13:59 - Neku: There're are like 13 files right

25/07/2023, 14:03 - Neku: When these guys decide to bring their light I'll probably copy paste the entire file and do a find and replace so the variable names are consistent
25/07/2023, 14:03 - Neku: Do we push at once or we take turns doing it one at a time
25/07/2023, 14:03 - Favour: Yh

12/08/2023, 13:04 - Neku: When, Where, What, and How to use closure!!!
First of all closure is not something you create it's something that the language has created for itself for appropriate development and we need to crack this code that how the language uses it.
"To be honest, a good developer's greatest fear is discovering that something working but not knowing how it works."What is Closure ?
    A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function references variables in the outer function's scope. When the inner function is returned from the outer function, it retains a reference to the outer function's scope, and can continue to access those variables even after the outer function has finished executing. Vice-Versa is not true!!    In simple terms a closure can "remember" values from its outer function's scope and use them later, even if the outer function has returned and those values would normally be out of scope.
When to use closure concept ?
FIrst let's summarize the definition as usually the definition gives the answer for when to use..
    From definition you can see that it's used for retrival of values from outer parent function so we can understand that closure can be used for retrival of dead values which have become out of scope. also we can comprehend that it can used for privating some varibles or function.    Thus closures are useful for creating private variables and functions, implementing partial function application, and preserving state in asynchronous code.    While writing the code whenever there is a need for these types of thing try to incorporate this closure concept i.e. In a programmer languge it's called lexical environment
Where and How to use closure concept ?
    Private variables and functions:
const makeCounter = () => {  let count = 0;    return () => {    count++;    console.log(count);  }}
let counter = makeCounter();counter(); // logs 1counter(); // logs 2counter(); // logs 3
    In this example, makeCounter is an arrow function that returns another arrow function. The returned function increments a count variable each time it is called, and logs the new value of count to the console.    When makeCounter is called, it creates a new scope with a count variable initialized to 0. It then returns a new arrow function that "closes over" this scope and increments the count variable each time it is called.    When we assign the returned arrow function to the counter variable, we create a closure that retains a reference to the count variable.    Each time we call counter(), it increments the count variable and logs the new value to the console, because it is still "closing over" the original count variable in the outer function's scope.    Thus because the count variable is not exposed outside of the returned object, it is effectively a private variable that can only be accessed or modified through the makeCounter() methods.
    Partial function:    I was introduced to this concept name during development phase but was shocked that unknowingly I have used it many times. I'm sure that you all also must have use this:
function add(x) {  return function(y) {    return x + y;  }}
let add5 = add(5);console.log(add5(3)); // 8
    In this example, the add() function returns another function that takes a single argument and returns the sum of that argument and the x value from the outer function's scope.    This allows us to "partially apply" the add() function by passing in an x value and getting back a new function that always adds that value to its argument.    Thuse we can then use the new function like any other function, passing in different y values as needed.
    For preserving states in asynchronous code:    The below snippet is from my personal project:)
const animate = (element, from, to, duration) => {  let start = performance.now();    const update = () => {    let time = performance.now() - start;    let progress = time / duration;    let value = from + (to - from) * progress;        element.style.left = value + 'px';        if (progress < 1) {      requestAnimationFrame(update);    }  }    requestAnimationFrame(update);}
let element = document.getElementById('my-element');animate(element, 0, 100, 1000);
    In this example, the animate() function creates a closure over the start variable, which is used to calculate the elapsed time since the animation started.    The update() function also "closes over" the element, from, to, and duration arguments, so that it can use them to update the element's position over time.    Thus by creating a closure over these values, we can preserve their state between animation frames, even though the update() function is called asynchronously by requestAnimationFrame().
Answer to todays(#2) JS challenge:
var createCounter = function(n) {    return ()=> n++}; 
When, Where, What, and How to use closure!!!
First of all closure is not something you create it's something that the language has created for itself for appropriate development and we need to crack this code that how the language uses it.
"To be honest, a good developer's greatest fear is discovering that something working but not knowing how it works."What is Closure ?
    A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function references variables in the outer function's scope. When the inner function is returned from the outer function, it retains a reference to the outer function's scope, and can continue to access those variables even after the outer function has finished executing. Vice-Versa is not true!!    In simple terms a closure can "remember" values from its outer function's scope and use them later, even if the outer function has returned and those values would normally be out of scope.
When to use closure concept ?
FIrst let's summarize the definition as usually the definition gives the answer for when to use..
    From definition you can see that it's used for retrival of values from outer parent function so we can understand that closure can be used for retrival of dead values which have become out of scope. also we can comprehend that it can used for privating some varibles or function.    Thus closures are useful for creating private variables and functions, implementing partial function application, and preserving state in asynchronous code.    While writing the code whenever there is a need for these types of thing try to incorporate this closure concept i.e. In a programmer languge it's called lexical environment
Where and How to use closure concept ?
    Private variables and functions:
const makeCounter = () => {  let count = 0;    return () => {    count++;    console.log(count);  }}
let counter = makeCounter();counter(); // logs 1counter(); // logs 2counter(); // logs 3
    In this example, makeCounter is an arrow function that returns another arrow function. The returned function increments a count variable each time it is called, and logs the new value of count to the console.    When makeCounter is called, it creates a new scope with a count variable initialized to 0. It then returns a new arrow function that "closes over" this scope and increments the count variable each time it is called.    When we assign the returned arrow function to the counter variable, we create a closure that retains a reference to the count variable.    Each time we call counter(), it increments the count variable and logs the new value to the console, because it is still "closing over" the original count variable in the outer function's scope.    Thus because the count variable is not exposed outside of the returned object, it is effectively a private variable that can only be accessed or modified through the makeCounter() methods.
    Partial function:    I was introduced to this concept name during development phase but was shocked that unknowingly I have used it many times. I'm sure that you all also must have use this:
function add(x) {  return function(y) {    return x + y;  }}
let add5 = add(5);console.log(add5(3)); // 8
    In this example, the add() function returns another function that takes a single argument and returns the sum of that argument and the x value from the outer function's scope.    This allows us to "partially apply" the add() function by passing in an x value and getting back a new function that always adds that value to its argument.    Thuse we can then use the new function like any other function, passing in different y values as needed.
